  - Calendar integration
  - Event tracking
  - Timeline analysis
  
- Disruption Detection
  - Multi-facility monitoring
  - Delay pattern recognition
  - Impact assessment
  
- Autonomous Response
  - Solution generation
  - Schedule optimization
  - Stakeholder notification
  
- Learning System
  - Historical data analysis
  - Pattern recognition
  - Response effectiveness tracking

#### Database (Firebase)
- Real-time data storage
- Authentication
- Event logging
- Historical data storage

#### Integration Points
- Google Calendar API
- IoT Data Simulation
- Notification System

### Voice Interaction System
```

Deepgram STT API
    ↓
AI Processing (Gemini/Groq)
    ↓
Google TTS API
    ↓
Voice Response
```

#### Voice Components
- Speech-to-Text Processing
- Natural Language Understanding
- Context Management
- Text-to-Speech Output
- Voice Command Recognition

## Security and Authentication
- Firebase Authentication
- Google Calendar OAuth
- API Security Measures

## Performance Considerations

### Rate Limits and Resource Management
- AI Agent processing is computationally intensive
- Implemented rate limiting for API calls
- Batch processing for non-urgent tasks
- Caching system for frequent queries
- Priority queue for critical operations

### Resource Optimization
```
Priority Levels:
1. Critical (Real-time disruptions)
2. Important (Calendar updates)
3. Normal (Email notifications)
4. Background (Analytics)
```

## File Structure Details

### Frontend Organization


### Backend Organization

## Configuration Setup

### Google Calendar Configuration
1. Create `.env` file in the backend root directory
2. Add the following configuration:
```
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_EMAIL=aotdevimpact@gmail.com
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CREDENTIALS_FILE=calendar_credentials.json
```

### Secure Credential Storage
- Credentials are stored in encrypted configuration
- Access is managed through environment variables
- Production deployments should use secret management services
- Development teams should request access from system administrators
