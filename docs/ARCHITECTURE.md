# Technical Architecture

## System Architecture

### 1. AI Agent System
The solution comprises three main AI components:

#### Main Agent (Real-time Monitor)
- Monitors real-time logistics data
- Compares actual vs. planned schedules
- Proposes solutions for disruptions
- Interfaces with Google Calendar
- Communicates with stakeholders
- Requires human confirmation for actions

#### Predictive Analysis Agent
- Captures historical disruption data
- Analyzes patterns in supply chain issues
- Updates training data automatically
- Provides early warning for potential issues

#### Sales Prediction Agent
- Forecasts product demand
- Assists in inventory management
- Integrates with supply chain planning

### 2. Data Flow
```
IoT Devices (Simulated)
    ↓
FastAPI/Flask Backend
    ↓
AI Processing Layer
    ↓
Firebase Database
    ↓
Flutter Web Interface
```

### 3. Technical Components

#### Frontend (Flutter/Dart)
- Web-based dashboard
- Real-time monitoring interface
- Action confirmation panels
- Status visualization

#### Backend Services
- **FastAPI**: Main API service
- **Flask**: Secondary API service
- **Python AI Modules**:
  - Real-time monitoring
  - Predictive analytics
  - Sales forecasting

#### Database (Firebase)
- Real-time data storage
- Authentication
- Event logging
- Historical data storage

#### Integration Points
- Google Calendar API
- IoT Data Simulation
- Notification System

### Voice Interaction System
```
User Voice Input
    ↓
Deepgram STT API
    ↓
AI Processing (Gemini/Groq)
    ↓
Google TTS API
    ↓
Voice Response
```

#### Voice Components
- Speech-to-Text Processing
- Natural Language Understanding
- Context Management
- Text-to-Speech Output
- Voice Command Recognition

## Security and Authentication
- Firebase Authentication
- Google Calendar OAuth
- API Security Measures

## Performance Considerations

### Rate Limits and Resource Management
- AI Agent processing is computationally intensive
- Implemented rate limiting for API calls
- Batch processing for non-urgent tasks
- Caching system for frequent queries
- Priority queue for critical operations

### Resource Optimization
```
Priority Levels:
1. Critical (Real-time disruptions)
2. Important (Calendar updates)
3. Normal (Email notifications)
4. Background (Analytics)
```

## Configuration Setup

### Google Calendar Configuration
1. Create `.env` file in the backend root directory
2. Add the following configuration:
```
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_EMAIL=aotdevimpact@gmail.com
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CREDENTIALS_FILE=calendar_credentials.json
```

### Secure Credential Storage
- Credentials are stored in encrypted configuration
- Access is managed through environment variables
- Production deployments should use secret management services
- Development teams should request access from system administrators
